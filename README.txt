- Development of a weather station - (2020)

The goal of this project is the creation of a remote weather station, acquiring data (temperature, humidity, luminosity...).
All data are transmitted to a server thanks to MQTT protocol and stored on it. 
These data are accessible via a dashboard through a http address. 


Several parts were developped:
- Embedded system on Arduino
- IHM through NodeRed
- MQTT Server & Broker on RaspPi
